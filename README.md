# Express Interceptor

## Early in development, no NPM package available yet

Inspired by https://github.com/hsponberg/destiny, Express Interceptor is a lightweight middleware that can be added to any Express.js server.

Express Interceptor middleware will need to be set up before defining the API, then initialised afterwards (see server.js).

It should only be used in a development environment, and provides a simple user interface on your server with the route of /interceptor i.e.

http://localhost:8080/interceptor

## Running the test server

```
yarn
npm start
```
